## Motivation

I was always curious how video games work: how the design made, how you can control whatever happening on a screen, basicaly, how to make a beautiful interface and what is behind it. That is why I set a goal to build a simple 2D video game to learn how to use graphic APIs.

## Game Description

In this game you can:

• Control player's space ship with A, W, S, D and arrow keys

• Shoot enemies and meteors using space

• Kill and get killed

• Get hit by enemy's space ships (50 hit points) and meteors (20 hit points)

• Collect points by killing enemies and meteors

• Lose life by losing 100 hit points

• Exit pressing ESC
