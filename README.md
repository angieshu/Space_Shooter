# Space_Shooter

Space Shooter is a simple 2D video game, imlemented in C++ using SDL libraries. Player's space ship can be moved using A, W, S, D and arrow keys.

## Motivation

I was always curious how video games work: how the design made, how you can control whatever happening on a screen, basicaly, how to make a beautiful interface and what is behind it. That is why I set a goal to build a simple 2D video game to learn how to use graphic APIs.

## Game Description

In this game you can:

• Control player's space ship with A, W, S, D and arrow keys

• Shoot enemies and meteors using space

• Kill and get killed

• Get hit by enemy's space ships (50 hit points) and meteors (20 hit points)

• Collect points by killing enemies and meteors

• Lose life by losing 100 hit points

• Exit pressing ESC

## Getting Started

For those who insterested to create something similar you need to install SDL packages. You can find the ones I used in folder SDL_packages.

To install you just need to copy those three packages to /Library/Frameworks.

Then run following commands in your Terminal:

```
cd /Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework/

codesign -f -s - SDL2

cd /Library/Frameworks/SDL2_image.framework/

codesign -f -s - SDL2_image

cd /Library/Frameworks/SDL2_ttf.framework/

codesign -f -s - SDL2_ttf
```

Thanks to [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org) you can have a great design and don't spend a lot of time on creating it by yourself.

## Code Overview

In this program I made several classes: Background, AUnit, and its inheritors Player, Enemy, Meteor, Star and Fireball.


#### Background class

Probably, the biggest class in this program. Here I control background (obviously): create enemies, stars, meteors, make them move down and check collisions with player's bullets.

Enemies, meteors and stars are stored in arrays. This way easier manage creation, movements and collisions. All of them created at the top of the game window at random X position.
For example, that is how meteors generated:

In display*() functions objects get rended to the screen.

In hit*() functions I check if the player got hit by enemy or meteor, and if he/she did, reduce his/her Hit Points. If there is not enough points, player loses life. If that was the last life function returns true meaning that the player died and game over :

drawInfoBox() function creates a box at the bottom of the game screen with info about current score, time spent in the game, lives left and Hit Points.


#### AUnit class

AUnit is an abstract class for all units you could find in the game: Player, Enemy, Meteor, Star and even Fireball.

Here we have widht and height of an object, its position on a screen and its image. Also getter- and setter- along with movement-functions are present. load() and render() load and render object's image to the screen respectively:

#### Player class

Inherit from AUnit class. Stores info about bullets used, current score, lives left, Hit Points, and colliders. Beside getter- and setter-functions has its own moveDown() function. Also has unique functions: moveBullets,() shoot(), containes(), kill().

containes() functions check for collision with Enemy and Meteor:

kill() function checks if Enemy or Meteor got killed by bullets:

#### Fireball class

Inherit from AUnit class. Called only from Player class. Has its own moveDown() and two unique functions contains() that check for collisions with Enemy and Meteor.

#### Enemy, Meteor and Star classes

Inherit from AUnit class. Have their own moveDown() and no unique functions. Built more or less in the same way :
